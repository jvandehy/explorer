1. General Issues
1.1  What is this journal? 
	This is a journal for me to track ideas I get while I am in exploring mode. I think writing helps me learn and "explore". A side benefit, at least initally is that I am writing this using the Vim editor, and I hope that using Vim will help me learn its features. I am also trying to do the keyboarding without looking at the keyboard. 

2. Vim Editor
2.1 Introdution
	I want to learn to use the Vim editor. The process of creating this journal may help, especially if I write using Vim!
2.2 The Vim Book
	Oualline, Steve (2007) The Vim Tutorial and Reference a.k.a. The Vim Book
