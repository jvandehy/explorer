1. General Issues
1.1  What is this journal? 
	This is a journal for me to track ideas I get while I am in exploring mode. I think writing helps me learn and "explore". A side benefit, at least initally is that I am writing this using the Vim editor, and I hope that using Vim will help me learn its features. I am also trying to do the keyboarding without looking at the keyboard. 
1.2 Entries 
	1.2.1 September 28, 2017: Today I mostly developed the idea of the explorer journal. I added the Vim section and it's Introduction.
	1.2.2 September 30, 2017: Today I am adding the "Entries" Section. Added Basic Editing section of Vim Book.
